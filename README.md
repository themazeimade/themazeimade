Hi,

My name is Tom Castro

This github is for the develop of my own tools, dot files and learning.

I use nvim, arch, qtile.

Right now I'm learning DirectX12 and Vulkan.

Also I like to read many types of research papers, from computer graphics to humanity topics.

If you like something on this git, feel free to fork it, dm me or anything.
